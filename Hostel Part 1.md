We left the untouched, bittersweet beauty of Malpais early the next day, my hands at ten and two. Rarely in life do we get the opportunity to experience raw, natural beauty and here it felt as if we were running from it.

The bad country had given us emotionally juxtaposed memories. It will always be the first place I surfed and I can always look back on the genuine goodness of Julio; yet it was a trying place and to leave it felt in some ways defeatist.

Climbing the hill out of Malpais, there was a swift and unanimous vote to take costal, longer route back instead of my “short cut”. Making a hard right, headed due east into the sunrise we spotted a hitchhiker. The traveller’s bag obstructed so much of his or her body we couldn’t tell what we were rolling up on. Given the rather somber mood in the car I called an audible and pulled over to pick up the stranger. Before the hitchhiker got close enough I told Joe to show no restraint if there was any funny business.

Turns out our guest was a young Estonian girl named Liz. She had been studying psychology and doing freelance journalism before she decided to take time off and travel Central America. Back to that in a moment, but more importantly what was she thinking! She just climbed into a car that looked like it had just been through a demolition derby on the side of a mountain filled with three enormous, bearded dudes that hadn’t been properly clean for a week. It’s potentially a reassuring nod for Los Gringos Gigantes that we exuded an aura of trust worthiness. That or Liz had been through some hardcore shit in Central America already and had a huge blade up her sleeve for protection.

She told us that the Costa Rican buses were so slow she’d jump in anyone’s car. You hear that Costa Rican Department of Transportation!? All those horror movies about torture and getting your kidneys harvested are less frightening than traveling on your buses.

Liz was an excellent hitchhiker. Though reticent at first she opened up about her adventures from Panama north where eventually she’d have to return south and fly home at an undecided date. She was the first European traveller we had a chance to talk to about their culture of international travel. After talking to a few other people at her University who had travelled abroad she decided to take the leap. Armed with a hiking backpack and an international cell phone she’d conquered Latin America for over a month.

Alas, Liz was only looking for a ride to the ferry (the same I chose to skip) a mere hour and fifteen minutes from Malpais. We wished her the safest travels, though I got the distinct feeling she wasn’t very worried about that. Then it was the three of us again, guided by Google Maps, headed due north to Arenal.

Arenal was home to one of the nations most well known volcanoes. Dormant for half a decade, the earth’s once fire breathing monster was home to lush forests, fed by nutrient rich volcanic soil, famous hot springs and a giant recreational lake. It would be hours, however, before the skyline was graced with the sleeping dragon.

With Liz asea Joe was alone in the backseat again and soon snoring. The seemingly cascading events of the past 24 hours weighed heavily on me, but even more so on Kerry. Malpais had one more “gift” for us: pensive, lay philosophizing. The dichotomy of ownership was pervasive. That’s a rather existential sentence but I mean that the belongings we’re attached to are simply fleeting. Truly valuable things can never be owned outside of ones mind and often times the most important part of our memories is simply the essence of them: how and why they made us feel.

Our conversation flowed like the foreign road we were on: winding, with no speed limit or signs for guidance. We relied on the tools we’d been taught to use, though they’d been proven underdeveloped just days earlier.

The implications of being aware of one's perpetual cognitive adolescence is both paralyzing and yet empowering. It’s easily relatable to the tenants of every major religion (though I’m not quite sure about Scientology) in that we are not perfect. Instead of becoming complacent, life is about testing hypothesis; right or wrong, testing life’s perceived boundaries is what really matters.

Presented with every opportunity to shut down and be bitter, Kerry rose to the occasion and accepted the ephemeral nature of possessions. Choosing to live in the moment, he displayed a strength of character I wouldn’t have been able to match if put in his situation.

As lunch approached our hibernating gringo in the backseat stirred and we put our armchair philosophy on the backburner in search of sustenance. Refueled, both nutritionally and automotively, Kerry took the wheel as we turned our wheels due east again in search of fresh mountain air. Winding even higher the humidity slowly fell, inversely correlated to the greenness. Quepos certainly didn’t lack jungle vegetation but as we approached Lake Arenal a whole new level of plant density and vibrance grew around us.

We stopped on the eastern edge of the lake, hundreds of feet above, and absorbed the magnificent vista. It was relieving to see our final trip destination; travel had been exhausting. Before we could find a place to settle thought we had to weave around the snaking road that encircled Lake Arenal because the National Park prevented us from going directly to the town of La Fortuna. The forebodingly long drive around the lake and volcano passed without leaving a strong enough impression as we were tired and hungry.

La Fortuna, the little town at the base of Arenal, was quaint. So quaint in fact we didn’t realize the shop weren’t yelling at us to sell us stuff but rather to tell us we were driving the wrong way on a one way. A bit embarrassed by our tourist behavior we made a quick stop at an adventure guide sales office, partly because they advertised for Adrienne’s friend’s canyoning trip. Honestly unsure of what we’d do in La Fortuna/Arenal we listened to our hombre’s pitch. Rappelling, rafting, ATV tours, horseback rides, ziplines - they were all available in this adventurist mecca.

Overwhelmed and equally unsure of our course of action as we were before his pitch we took reading material and asked him where we should stay. Without hesitation he recommended Hostel Backpackers. We had yet to stay in a hostel and were feeling overly protective of our belongings but we decided to check it out nonetheless.
